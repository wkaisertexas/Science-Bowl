# Science Bowl Program
This is a program with the goal of managing science bowl games, which typically require 3 people to run officially; thereby, interfering with team practice. 

# What does this program do?
This program condenses the science bowl game management into a task that is able to be done by only a single person. This is done by having two windows, on is for the reader, the other is for the audience. The reader displays the question, and the time and score window displays the time and score for the players to see.

This program is currently still in development, but will be completed in the near future.
